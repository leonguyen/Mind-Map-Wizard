Create a comprehensive, fact-rich mind map about: ${input}

Generate the mind map as Markdown text using the following structure:

# Matching Mind Map Title
## Branch 1
### Sub Branch A
### Sub Branch B
## Branch 2

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Each text element must be aligned to a specific hierarchical level using a new line plus the appropriate number of # symbols
- Aim for 2-3 levels of depth to keep the mind map scannable and not overwhelming
- For large enumerations (6+ items), combine related items into comma-separated lists within a single branch rather than creating excessive sub-branches

**Content Requirements:**
- Include **specific, concrete details and facts**, not just category labels
  - ❌ Bad: "## Education" 
  - ✅ Good: "## Education: PhD in Physics from MIT (2015)"
- Avoid generic structural sections like "Overview," "Introduction," or "Conclusion" – this is a mind map, not an essay
- If the topic contains extensive information, prioritize breadth over depth and consolidate where necessary
- Focus on the most relevant and interesting information that creates a useful knowledge structure
- Make the branches have different lengths for making the mind map visually more interesting.

**Output Format:**
Structure your response exactly like this:
{
	"markdown": "# Main Topic\\n\\n## Subtopic 1\\n- Point A\\n- Point B\\n\\n## Subtopic 2\\n- Point C\\n- Point D"
}
